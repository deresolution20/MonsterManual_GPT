## Description
AI Custom Monster Manual Creator is a tool designed for tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) enthusiasts, particularly those who enjoy Dungeons and Dragons (D&D). This CustomGPT-powered tool generates custom images, stat blocks, and lore for characters, NPCs, monsters, spells, feats, and more, enriching the TTRPG experience.

## How It Works
Users provide a description or motivation for a character, NPC, monster, spell, feat, etc., for use within a D&D campaign. The AI then generates relevant content, including:

- Images (generated upon request)
- Stat blocks
- Backgrounds
- Motivations
- Lore
- Other elements to build a comprehensive TTRPG experience

### Text-Based Responses
All text-based responses, including stat blocks and lore, are provided in Markdown format. This ensures ease of reading and integration into various platforms.

### Image Generation
Images are generated only upon user request, adding a visual dimension to the textual content.

### Homebrewery Compatibility
The stat block Markdown can be directly copied and pasted into the [Homebrewery tool Github Repo](https://github.com/naturalcrit/homebrewery), or the web version, [Homebrewery tool](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/), allowing users to create high-quality pages that mimic the official D&D book's style.

## Example Usage

### Elven Mindflayer
*create a mindflayer who used to be an elf prince.  He was captured and forced to undergo ceremorphosis and is pretty angry about it.*




### Markdown Export
Use the `/markdown` command to export the stat block in Markdown format for easy copying and pasting into your campaign notes.
